					                    <h1>Structural Integrity Assessment</h1>
					<p>Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, and floods, as well as manmade disasters such as explosions and arson, can all cause immense damage to the structural integrity of buildings and infrastructure. Even small-scale events can cause serious damage. For example, the 2011 Virginia Earthquake, though measuring only 5.8 on the Richter scale, caused significant structural damage to such famous landmarks as the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral. Assessing structural damage after a disaster can potentially be risky. Assessors could have to enter buildings in danger of collapse or access hard-to-reach places like the undersides of bridges. Our drones have proven useful in assessing structural damage over a wide area, locally, and even in building interiors.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h1>Reconnaissance and Mapping</h1>
					<p>Maps of geographic features, infrastructure, etc. of disaster-prone areas are paramount to disaster response. The Eagle identifies infrastructure that is in critical condition after disasters and takes precautionary actions can be taken by first-responders. Mapping of these areas both before and after disasters is essential. Manned aircrafts can be expensive and the images taken by satellites are not high resolution and are variable, dependent on weather conditions, time, etc. and cannot be used effectively for large-scale images. Our drones are more readily deployable than satellites or manned aircraft and can create higher resolution maps. Rapid deployment of drone-based remote sensing systems after a disaster, combined with high resolution “before” maps, will allow disaster relief groups to obtain situational awareness and know which infrastructure is at the greatest risk, allowing them to triage relief efforts to limit overall damages. They also be used to plan reconstruction activities.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h1>Search and Rescue</h1>
					<p>The Eagle is made to search for people or wreckage over vast areas like deserts, oceans, and rugged mountainous terrain. These are tasks that would otherwise lead to crew fatigue, decreasing their effectiveness in searching and increasing the likelihood of pilot error. Furthermore, once survivors are located, many rescue / evacuation operations must be carried out in hazardous environments (CBRNE, low visibility, rugged terrain, etc.).
					<br>The Eagle is engineered for...
					<br>* Undersea operations after crises such as a plane crash
					<br>* Assist with sending out alerts or deploy life saving devices out at sea
					<br>* Mountain rescue after avalanche
					<br>* Post mud slides, earthquakes, tsunami rescue and recovery</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h1>Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) Events</h1>
					<p>Heavy industry and power generation relies on hazardous chemicals and fuels, including fissile material to create nuclear power. These devastating events require fast and effective disaster response and relief efforts, but by their nature are extremely unsafe for relief workers. Our drones significantly reduce human exposure to unsafe environments while providing continuous monitoring and data validation in the most extreme conditions. The Eagle is used to swiftly deliver relief supplies, ground-based monitoring equipment, repair tools, spare parts, and other important materials to the relief workers and environmental cleanup crews.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h1>Is this safe?</h1>
					<p>We have an unparalleled focus on safety, privacy and security. We are developing industry-leading technology to ensure our drones are safe and reliable.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h1>Is this legal?</h1>
					<p>Drones can be operated commercially in a growing number of countries. We’re in discussions with regulators all around the world, and we’re helping to shape the regulations and systems that will make drone delivery the most effective, personal and frictionless delivery method in the market.</p>

					<h3>Wildfire Detection and Extinguishing</h3>
                    <p>Flying under such conditions is inherently dangerous, and also puts a high stress load on the pilot, risking the safety of the entire crew. Our Eagle Bot eliminates this risk by allowing the pilot to operate from a safe distance. When applying retardants, this can also allow the drone to more directly engage the fire. Using drones could drastically increase the amount of time that firefighters are able to directly engage the fire by flying in low visibility conditions.
